## Video Intelligence Analyzer (VIA)

This repository now includes a backend reference implementation for the **Video Intelligence Analyzer (VIA)** project described in the accompanying software requirements document. The service lives under [`backend/`](backend) and exposes a FastAPI application capable of processing uploaded MP4 files or YouTube URLs, running them through the VIA pipeline, and returning transcripts, detections, analytics, and summaries.

See [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) for setup and usage instructions.
